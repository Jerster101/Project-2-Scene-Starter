Scene randomly generates 2 front trees and height of foreground mountains, background mountains, and a mass of green trees in the midground.
The clouds react to the user's mouse, scrolling across the sky.
I tried to replicate the image in the source files with randomness.  It could have turned out better, but I think I did a good job for my experience level.
